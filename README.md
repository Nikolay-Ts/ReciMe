An app to help you pick your next meal!

## About 

ReciMe was designed because I am very indecisive with what I want to eat. Instead of having a recipe book or something else, I decided to build an app to help me do that for me. Recime me has 3 main ways to help users chose what to eat. 

1. Randomly!
2. Based on categories an restrictions (i.e only chicken or only breakfast foods, etc)
3. Based on ingredients users have in their fridge or laying.

## Home Page

The home page has the daily dish which is a randomly chosen dish that refreshes every day. This dish can be absolutely anything including deserts!

When pressing on 'more info' the users are navigated to the Recipe view where it shows all of the information about the dish and even a youtube video containing instructions on how to make the dish.
